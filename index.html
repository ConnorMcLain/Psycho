    <p>Learning about psychopathy has been a recent interest of mine. It baffles me that somebody can completely run their own lives without a drop of sympathy.
      <br><br>
      There are several elements to this neurological/psychological condition that I have learned about so far:

        <p>According to the revised version of prominent psychologist Robert Hare <a href="http://www.minddisorders.com/Flu-Inv/Hare-Psychopathy-Checklist.html" target="_blank">Found Here</a>, there are 20 known identifiable traits that can help a psycologist "score" a person/patient with this condition, and they are as follows:
          <ol>
            <li>glib and superficial charm</li>
            <li>grandiose (exaggeratedly high) estimation of self</li>
            <li>need for stimulation</li>
            <li>pathological lying</li>
            <li>cunning and manipulativeness</li>
            <li>lack of remorse or guilt</li>
            <li>shallow affect (superficial emotional responsiveness)</li>
            <li>callousness and lack of empathy</li>
            <li>parasitic lifestyle</li>
            <li>poor behavioral controls</li>
            <li>sexual promiscuity </li>
            <li>early behavior problems</li>
            <li>lack of realistic long-term goals</li>

            <li>revocation of conditional release</li>
            <li>criminal versatility</li>

        <h2 id="psycho and socio">What separates a psychopath from a sociopath?</h2>

          <h3 class='point'>The Answer is in the Individual's Origin</h3>

            <p><strong>Psychopaths</strong> and <strong>Sociopaths</strong> are often confused for one another to the layperson, but there's a distinct difference in how they originate.
              <br><br>
            <p><strong>Psychopaths</strong> are thought to be born the way they are, due to a marked difference in their brain's "<a href="https://newatlas.com/psychopath-brain-mri-study/50365/" target="_blank">hardwiring</a>" from birth, and there is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2242349/" target="_blank">scientific evidence</a> to show that this hardwiring pattern has a genetic basis.
              <strong>Psychopaths</strong> are also known to conduct themselves in a much more controlled and deliberate manner, which is evidenced in the way they commit crimes.</p>
              <br><br>
            <p><strong>Sociopaths</strong> are thought to be made into sociopaths due to influence from an abusive childhood environment.
